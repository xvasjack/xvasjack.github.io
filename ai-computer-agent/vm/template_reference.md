## What MBB-Quality Means

MBB (McKinsey, Bain, BCG) quality = every slide delivers actionable insight, not just information. The reader should finish a slide knowing **what to do next**, not just what exists.

**Core principles:**
- Every description answers "so what?" — why does this company/market matter to the client?
- Data is contextualized: not just "revenue $50M" but "revenue $50M, growing 15% YoY, outpacing sector average of 8%"
- Recommendations are specific and tied to evidence
- Next steps are concrete actions, not vague suggestions

## Market Research (`market-research`)

### Expected Content Elements
- **Market sizing**: TAM/SAM/SOM with dollar figures and growth rates (CAGR)
- **Competitive landscape**: Key players with market share estimates, positioning map
- **Demand drivers**: What's fueling growth — regulatory, technology, demographic shifts
- **Strategic recommendations**: 3-5 specific actions the client should consider
- **Risk factors**: What could go wrong, with likelihood and impact assessment
- **Next steps**: Concrete follow-up actions (e.g., "conduct deep-dive on top 3 targets", "engage regulatory counsel on X")

### Quality Indicators
- Company descriptions: 50+ words each, citing specific metrics (revenue, growth, market share)
- Market data: Quantified with sources (e.g., "according to Grand View Research, 2024")
- Slides have 3+ substantive text blocks (not just a title and one bullet)
- Language includes: "recommend", "opportunity", "strategy", "should consider", "outlook", "implication"

### Anti-Patterns (Red Flags)
- "X is a company that provides..." (Wikipedia-style)
- "Founded in [year], headquartered in [city]" as the only description
- No market size numbers anywhere
- No growth rates or forecasts
- Slides with just company name + one-line description
- Generic phrases: "is a leading provider", "offers a wide range of services"
